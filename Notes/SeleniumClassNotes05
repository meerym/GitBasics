DropDown: is a menu or method which allows user to select one or multiple options

types of DropDown

1.Single select

2.Multiple select


    2 WAYS to perform actions on DropDown:

       1.just clicking on a DropDown and clicking on the option
       2.using Select class

in order to use the select class we need to make sure that we have a <select> tagName

    Selecting options can be done in 3 ways:
       1.select by index
       2. select by visible text
       3.select by value
       
       
       Select select = new Select(dayDD); --> webElement has to have a select tag
       
       To identify whether DD is multiple select or single select
